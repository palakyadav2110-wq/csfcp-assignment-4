# Overview – Portfolio Website (CSF Mini Project)

This mini project is a simple and clean **Portfolio Website**, created using basic HTML and CSS as part of the Computer Science Fundamentals (CSF) curriculum. The objective of the project is to learn the fundamentals of web development, folder structure management, documentation, and version control using Git and GitHub.

The portfolio contains three main sections:

* **Home Section** – Displays the title and introduction
* **About Me Section** – Short description about the student
* **Projects Section** – Highlights current or future projects

The website is fully static and easy to run on any browser without installation. The project follows good development practices, including proper folder organization, meaningful commits, and documentation. Screenshots have been added to show the website layout and design.

This project demonstrates foundational skills in HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and project documentation, preparing the student for more advanced development in future semesters.
